# BattleShip

Developed a fully-featured, web-based version of the classic game of Battleship using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Utilized webpack and npm for asset management and deployment. Implemented object-oriented programming principles and utilized algorithms for game logic and AI opponent functionality. Designed a user-friendly interface for players to input their moves and receive game updates. Incorporated dynamic DOM manipulation to update the game status and player moves. The project helped me to improve my web development skills, problem-solving, critical thinking, debugging skills and greatly helped me understand Test Driven Development.
